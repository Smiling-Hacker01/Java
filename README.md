# Java Programming Repository 🚀

This repository is a complete collection of Java programs and practice codes organized by topics.  
It is designed for learning, practicing, and mastering **Core Java** and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.

---

## 📂 Folder Structure

- **01_basics** → Basic Java programs to get started (syntax, input/output, operators, etc.).
- **ArraysInJava** → Array concepts, traversals, searching, sorting, and related problems.
- **BitManipulation** → Programs related to bitwise operations and tricks.
- **FunctionsInJava** → Function definitions, overloading, recursion basics, etc.
- **JavaCollectionFrameWorks** → Java Collections Framework examples (ArrayList, HashMap, TreeMap, etc.).
- **LinkedList** → Singly & doubly linked list implementations and problems.
- **LoopsInJava** → Programs using for, while, and do-while loops.
- **OOPS** → Object-Oriented Programming in Java (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, interfaces).
- **RecursionInJava** → Recursive solutions to classic problems.
- **SortingInJava** → Sorting algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, etc.).
- **StringsInjava** → String manipulation and problems.
- **ConditionalStatements** → if-else, switch, nested conditions practice.
- **QuestionsPractice** → Mixed practice questions from multiple topics.
- **Practiceback** → Backup/practice space for additional experiments.
